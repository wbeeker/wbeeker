## Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm William Beeker

<!--
**wbeeker/wbeeker** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Secure Notes Web App using Spring Security.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Database Management Systems and Computer Systems. 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on security or privacy focused projects.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My background is in screenwriting. I used to write movie scripts, and now I write Python scripts.
